#+TITLE: jmax - John's customizations to maximize Emacs

Try it you will like it. These customizations have been compiled and derived from prelude and the emacs24-starterkit.

Clone the git repository, change into the jmax directory, and run this command:
#+begin_src sh
emacs -q -l init.el
#+end_src

This will load the emacs on your path, without using whatever you have defined in .emacs.d.

* Project goal
=jmax= is a customized version of emacs to facilitate authoring and consuming org-mode based technical documents.

All of the emacs customization is performed in an org-mode file.
