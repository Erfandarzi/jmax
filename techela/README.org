#+TITLE: Techela - Technology Enhanced Learning and Assessment
#+AUTHOR: John Kitchin

* Introduction

Techela is a framework for teaching courses. It provides a way to easily distribute, collect, grade, and return digital assignments. 

* Initial server setup
The initial setup of a techela server is described here.
** Create a new user
The server is run on an ordinary Linux server under a dedicated user. The username should be the name of the course. I used system-config-users and added the user org-course.

** install gitolite
gitolite is the git server we use to create and manage git repositories for the course. First, login as the user for the course, and then run these commands.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
cd $HOME
mkdir bin
gitolite/install --to $HOME/bin
#+END_SRC

** setup  the admin
All communication with gitolite is done through ssh. You need to supply an ssh key to setup the server. This key should be from the computer you will do most of the administration from.

On some machine, generate an ssh key pair. 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-keygen
#+END_SRC

I opted to do this with no passphrase. Copy the id_rsa.pub key to $HOME on the gitolite server as admin-username.pub. Now, run the setup command to add your public key.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gitolite setup -pk jkitchin.pub 
#+END_SRC

Initialized empty Git repository in /home/org-course/repositories/gitolite-admin.git/
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/org-course/repositories/testing.git/
WARNING: /home/org-course/.ssh missing; creating a new one
    (this is normal on a brand new install)
WARNING: /home/org-course/.ssh/authorized_keys missing; creating a new one
    (this is normal on a brand new install)
[org-course@jkitchin-780 ~]$ 

That is it. The rest can be done via the admin repo on a remote machine.

** clone the admin repo
Create a directory somewhere on your remote machine where you want the course to live. Then, clone the admin repo into it. 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone org-course@git-it.cheme.cmu.edu:gitolite-admin
#+END_SRC

** edit gitolite/gitolite.conf
Go ahead and configure git if you have not already done so.

  git config --global user.email "jkitchin@andrew.cmu.edu"
  git config --global user.name "John Kitchin"

Now, we create the course repo. This is the repo that all students will have access to. We define the @instructors team


Add this to gitolite.conf.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
@instructors = jkitchin mehakc

repo course
    RW+ = jkitchin
    RW = @instructors
    R = @students

# file containing all student usernames
include "students.conf"

# we create a single file for each student repo
include "repos/*.conf"
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir repos
touch repos/README
echo "student repo conf files go here" >> repos/README

touch students.conf
#+END_SRC

That creates the course repo, and sets up the directories and files we need to create student repos. You have to commit and push these changes to 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git add repos students.conf
git commit -m "add students.conf and repos"
git push
#+END_SRC

Now, you can clone the course repo.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone org-course@techela.cheme.cmu.edu:course
#+END_SRC

* Course setup in gitolite-admin
This section describes the "private" course setup, i.e. the part students do not need to see.

** keydir
gitolite requirement. Contains userid.pub files.

** conf
gitolite requirement. Contains gitolite.conf, which sets up repos.

*** conf/student-work
We can actually create repo.conf files in this directory, and they are included in the gitolite.conf automatically. We only make one repo.conf per repository.
*** conf/students.conf
This file defines the @students group. It is usually generated automatically from the roster.

** roster.dat
File containing registered students. This should be the datafile downloaded from fio, although any csv file with the userid in the second column, last name in the third column, and first name in the fourth column will do right now.

This form takes me straight there for 06-625 in the fall. You have to enter your andrewid and password.

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle roster.html
<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>06-625 Roster</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY onload="document.forms['foo'].submit();">

<p><form name="foo"
action="https://www.as.cmu.edu/fio/proc.formproc" 
method="post" <br />
<input type="hidden" name="VAR1" value="Fall 2014, 06625 A, CHMCL & REACTV SYSTM"><br />
<input type="hidden" name="ARGNUM" value=4>
<input type="hidden" name="FUNCNAME" value="run_datafile">
<input type="hidden" name="VAR2" value="screen"><br />
<input type="hidden" name="VAR3" value="FULL"><br />
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit"><br />
</form></p>

</HTML>
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-babel-tangle)
(browse-url "roster.html")
#+END_SRC

When you change the roster, you need to run elisp:ta-update-roster which will automatically update students.conf, and roster.org

** gradebook
This directory contains a grading file for each assignment. The files contain links to each file, and a summary of the grades.

** ../course
This is the student facing part of the course. The syllabus should go in here, and any course notes/materials. This is a separate git repository.

** ../student-work
Student repos will be cloned into this directory. This is where you will pull their work after it is collected.

** ../class-work
Class repos will be cloned here. This is where you pull class repos for analysis.

** ../assignments
Assignments are referred to by label. There should be a directory with the name "label" for each assignment. The contents of this directory will be copied to student repos, so do not put solutions here!

Each assignment should also contain #+POINTS, #+CATEGORY and #+DUEDATE information, which is added to the syllabus when you use elisp:ta-assign-assignment

You create a new assignment repo simply by:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone org-course@techela.cheme.cmu.edu:a/label
#+END_SRC

This automatically creates the remote repo and local directory. Then, you add your content to it and push it back. 

*** TODO how do you update the due dates? 
these always end up changing, and we will need to update the syllabus, and possibly student files.

* Providing anonymous access to the course directory in gitolite
So that students can get started right away on the first day, we enable anonymous read access to the course directory. Here is how we set that up. Note, this only works for one course.

Add this to your xinet.d directory 
#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle git
# default: off
# description: The git d√¶mon allows git repositories to be exported using \
#       the git:// protocol.

service git
{
        disable         = no
        socket_type     = stream
        wait            = no
        user            = daemon
        server          = /usr/libexec/git-core/git-daemon
        server_args     = --base-path=/home/org-course/repositories  --syslog --inetd --verbose
        log_on_failure  += USERID
}
#+END_SRC

Run this to restart all the xinetd instances.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo killall -HUP xinetd
#+END_SRC

We have to add daemon to the course group.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
usermod -a -G org-course daemon
#+END_SRC

And finally give the group read access to the course repository. Note that you have to give +x access to the parent directories.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod g+x /home/org-course
chmod g+x /home/org-course/repositories
chmod -R g+rx /home/org-course/repositories/course.git
#+END_SRC


* Running your course
** Create assignments
Each assignment exists in a directory LABEL in gitolite-admin/assignments. In this directory there should be a LABEL.org file. You put the assignment directions in that file. You can put whatever other files you want in the LABEL directory.

** TODO Assign assignments

** TODO Collect assignments

** TODO Grade assignments
