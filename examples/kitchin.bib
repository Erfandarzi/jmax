	We present density-functional calculations of the adsorption energy

	to 1 ML. The adsorption energy generally increases (gets weaker)
	with coverage in a near linear fashion for the most stable configurations.

	A consequence of this electronic structure-coverage correlation for
	each adsorbate is that the adsorption energies of each adsorbate
	configuration are strongly correlated with each other. All of the
	exceptions to these correlations can be traced to surface reconstruction
	or adsorbate configurations that are not geometrically similar to

	configurational correlation by scaling of the adsorption energies.},

	combination with the computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)
	model. We showed that by the discovery of a universal scaling relation
	between the adsorption energies of HOO* vs HO*, it is possible to
	analyze the reaction free energy diagrams of all the oxides in a
	general way. This gave rise to an activity volcano that was the same
	for a wide variety of oxide catalyst materials and a universal descriptor
	for the oxygen evolution activity, which suggests a fundamental limitation
	on the maximum oxygen evolution activity of planar oxide catalysts.},

	ultra-high vacuum conditions for gas sensor studies. Using a linear
	four-point probe (FPP), we investigated the effects of surface stoichiometry
	and of exposure to oxygen on the surface resistivity. We also investigated
	the effect of palladium (Pd) particles of varying sizes on the surface
	resistivity using both FPP and scanning tunneling microscopy. Our
	results showed that there was a strong dependence of the resistivity
	on the average Ti oxidation state of the clean TiO2 (0 0 1) surface.
	A decrease in the surface resistivity of TiO2 (0 0 1) was observed
	after the surface was reduced by Ar+ ion sputtering, whereas an increase
	in the resistivity of the sputtered-TiO2 surface was detected after
	reacting with gas-phase oxygen. In addition, we found that the presence
	of Pd particles enhanced the sensing performance to oxygen, and that
	the degree of enhancement depended strongly on the size of the Pd
	nanoparticles. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	of W=O (an oxygen species projecting outward from the pseudospherical
	H3PW12O40 molecule) serves as an atomically sharp and stable tip.
	Additionally, superimposed superperiodic structures commensurate
	with the underlying graphite lattice were regularly observed with
	the modified tips. This result suggests that tip functionalization
	with these metal oxide molecules may enhance resolution in a fashion
	analogous to functionalization with C-60.},
